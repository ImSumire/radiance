    <p>Generated by GPT-4o!!! (Will be 100% written by a human later)</p>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <p>
      To start a new project using the Radiance game framework, you can easily
      set it up by running the following command in your terminal:
    </p>
    <code>curl https://imsumire.github.io/radiance/raylibc.sh | sh</code>
    <p>
      This command downloads and executes a shell script that initializes the
      framework and sets up the necessary project structure.
    </p>

    <h3>Project Structure</h3>
    <p>
      Once the project is set up, you will see the following directory
      structure:
    </p>

    <h3>Running in Development Mode</h3>
    <p>To run your game in development mode with hot-reloading, execute the following command:</p>
    <code>scripts/hot.sh</code>
    <h4>What is Hot-Reloading?</h4>
    <p>Hot-reloading is a feature that allows you to make changes to your code and see the results immediately without restarting the entire application. This is particularly useful during development as it speeds up the iteration process, allowing you to test changes quickly and efficiently. It helps maintain your workflow and reduces downtime, making it easier to experiment with game mechanics and features.</p>

    <h3>Building and Running in Release Mode</h3>
    <p>To build your project for release, use the following command:</p>
    <code>scripts/build.sh</code>
    <p>You can run the project (automatic build) with:</p>
    <code>scripts/run.sh</code>
    <p>The target executable will be located at <b>target/linux/main</b>. This is the compiled version of your game, ready for distribution or further testing.</p>

    <h3>Starting to Code Your Game</h3>
    <p>To start coding your game, you will primarily work within the src/ directory. Here are some steps to get you started:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Define Your Game State: Open src/common/state.h and define the State struct to hold your game's data. You can add fields such as player score, position, health, etc.</li>
      <li>Implement Game Logic: Use lib.h to implement your game logic. The functions init, update, render, and drop are where you will define how your game initializes, updates each frame, renders graphics, and cleans up resources.</li>
      <li>Modify the Main Loop: In main.c, you can modify the game loop to include your game logic. The loop will continuously call the update and render functions, so you can modifiy anything (not hot-reloaded).</li>
    </ul>
